    blurb: 'Chat with Albert, Ask Albert’s HuCentAI Quant Analyst, in plain English — "Why did the score fall?", "What could move Bitcoin next?" — grounded strictly in the live dashboard numbers. He never invents data.' },
  { id: 'strategies', label: 'Trading Strategies', icon: Crosshair,
    blurb: 'Strategies Albert builds and babysits for you — each with an entry, profit targets, a stop and if-this-then-that rules on price, time and signals. Albert nudges you when it’s time to act, paper-tracks the P&L, and keeps a history of how past plays performed. Per coin.' },
  { id: 'alert-engine', label: 'Alert Engine', icon: Radar,
    blurb: 'Daily technical signal detectors — GMMA trend crossovers, trend pullback dip-buys, Bollinger volatility squeezes and RSI exhaustion — refined by volume, funding-rate, exchange-netflow and Fear & Greed filters. Scans your watchlist hourly and fires in-app alerts when a signal triggers.' },
  { id: 'overview', label: 'Overview', icon: LayoutDashboard,
    blurb: 'Your 10-second snapshot of Bitcoin right now: the price, the market "mood", one simple score, the near-term odds, how risky things are and how sure the model is. Start here.' },
  { id: 'forecasts', label: 'Forecasts', icon: Target,
    blurb: 'CryptoMarkAI’s probability-based price forecasts from 1 week to 5 years — always shown as odds and price ranges (bull / base / bear), never a single guaranteed number. Longer horizons show wider uncertainty.' },
  { id: 'compare', label: 'Compare Coins', icon: Scale,
    blurb: 'Run the same quant engine across Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana side by side — score, market mood, near-term odds and key levels — so you can see how the majors stack up. Each coin computes its own model on first view, then caches.' },
  { id: 'market-intel', label: 'Market Intelligence', icon: BarChart3,
    blurb: 'The technical picture behind the score: chart structure and key levels, where Bitcoin sits in its 4-year cycle, and the raw indicators the model reads.' },
  { id: 'drivers', label: 'Market Drivers', icon: Users,
    blurb: 'Who is actually moving Bitcoin right now — the first mover, the current leader, who is confirming or resisting, and who could rotate in next. A deterministic read across intraday, swing and cycle horizons, honest about what is observed versus inferred. Proposes posture; your portfolio rules decide any action.' },
  { id: 'crossmarket', label: 'Cross-Market', icon: Globe,
    blurb: 'How this coin stacks up against traditional markets — S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow, Nikkei, European indices, Gold and the US Dollar. See rebased performance, returns, correlation (is crypto moving with stocks or breaking away?) and volatility.' },
  { id: 'analogs', label: 'Happening Again', icon: History,
    blurb: "Finds which past Bitcoin trend episode today's conditions most resemble — using macro rates, the US dollar, equity & gold correlation, volatility, drawdown, momentum and halving-cycle position — then shows what happened next. Adjust the sliders to weight what matters to you. Educational pattern-matching, not a prediction." },

    blurb: 'On-chain "smart money" behaviour — valuation (MVRV, SOPR), network activity, holder accumulation and sentiment. Powered by real on-chain data (BGeometrics, blockchain.com, Glassnode) and Fear & Greed.' },
  { id: 'whales', label: 'Whale Watch', icon: Fish,
    blurb: 'Live balances of the largest, publicly-labeled Bitcoin wallets — major exchanges, ETF/treasury custody, governments and famous whales. Track who is accumulating or distributing, with balances fetched live on-chain. Names are curated from public labels.' },
  { id: 'institutional', label: 'Institutional & Derivatives', icon: Landmark,
    blurb: 'Institutional & derivatives footprint — futures open interest, funding, long/short positioning and taker flow (live via OKX), plus REAL US spot Bitcoin ETF net flows (live via Farside/bitbo).' },
  { id: 'leverage', label: 'Leverage', icon: Gauge,
    blurb: 'Long & short positioning, market leverage and liquidation pressure — is leverage high or low, are traders leaning long or short, and where is the greater squeeze/liquidation risk right now.' },
  { id: 'macro', label: 'Macro & Policy', icon: Globe,
    blurb: 'Are global money conditions helping or hurting Bitcoin? Central-bank policy, a liquidity gauge, cross-market correlations and a regulation tracker.' },

    blurb: 'The news, explained: what happened, why it matters for Bitcoin, the likely direction and an impact score — with links to the original source.' },
  { id: 'risk', label: 'Risk', icon: ShieldAlert,
    blurb: 'How bumpy conditions are right now — kept separate from direction. Expected move, key support/resistance zones, event risk and data reliability. A positive outlook can still be high risk.' },
  { id: 'events', label: 'Events', icon: CalendarClock,
    blurb: 'A countdown calendar of the macro, derivatives and on-chain events that could move Bitcoin next — each with importance and expected volatility.' },
  { id: 'performance', label: 'Performance', icon: Trophy,
    blurb: 'The receipts. Every forecast is logged before the outcome is known and graded when it matures — accuracy, calibration and an honest scoreboard, plus the data-trust log. Nothing is hidden.' },
  { id: 'timemachine', label: 'Bitcoin Time Machine', icon: History,
    blurb: 'Replay any day in Bitcoin’s history: see exactly what the model would have predicted then, what actually happened next, and the price path around it — using only the information available at the time.' },
  { id: 'alerts', label: 'Alerts', icon: Bell,
    blurb: 'A running feed of what just changed and what is coming: regime shifts, decision changes, data-trust drops and upcoming high-impact events.' },
  { id: 'network', label: 'Network & Sentiment', icon: Activity,
    blurb: 'Is the network healthy and how does the crowd feel? Live hashrate, mining difficulty, mempool congestion & fees, plus the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with Albert’s read on crowd extremes.' },
  { id: 'dataaudit', label: 'Data Audit', icon: Database,
    blurb: 'Where every number comes from and how much to trust it. A trust-scored composite Bitcoin price (median of Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, CoinGecko with outlier detection), broader cross-asset context, global news tone (GDELT) and US macro (FRED) — each tagged HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW confidence. No fabricated data.' },
  { id: 'settings', label: 'Settings', icon: Cpu,
    blurb: 'Admin passcode for manual forecast runs, plus Ask Albert’s about & compliance information. (Live data-source status now lives in the Admin screen.)' },
  { id: 'paper', label: 'Paper Bot', icon: FlaskConical,
    blurb: 'Your combined paper-trading performance — how every strategy is doing with virtual money, added up. Strategies are started and stopped on the strategy itself, where each one gets its own ring-fenced virtual wallet. No exchange keys, no real orders. Paper results are never mixed with backtests or your real portfolio.' },
  { id: 'paperengine', label: 'Paper Engine', icon: Wrench,
    blurb: 'The engine behind Paper Trading, in full technical detail: background-worker diagnostics, allocation-versus-limit calculations, market-cap ranking provenance, rotation internals, execution assumptions, reconciliation status and the complete fill → strategy version → canonical decision → market-observation evidence chain. Read-only — this screen never places or changes a paper trade.' },
  { id: 'checkup', label: 'App Checkup', icon: Stethoscope,
    blurb: 'Not sure if something is broken? Albert checks the parts of Ask Albert needed for the app to work — connectivity, services, market-data freshness, the engine and your session — then explains in plain English what (if anything) is wrong, how confident he is, and the single best next step. Reads health only; never changes your data.' },
  { id: 'admin', label: 'Admin', icon: ShieldCheck,
    blurb: 'Integrations, data-source freshness, usage, costs and system health for the Ask Albert platform.' },
