"""Discovery universe + eligibility rules (Phase D2).

Explicitly separates three stages:
  * DISCOVERY   — which assets get scored (the opportunity universe).
  * ELIGIBILITY — mandate / asset / data rules that decide if a scored asset may
                  ever be BOUGHT. An ineligible asset can still be scored and
                  shown, but must NEVER become BUY regardless of score.
  * DECISION    — BUY / SELL / HOLD / WAIT (in decision.py).

Eligibility here mirrors EXACTLY the hard gates that Phase C/D1 already enforce
(so no behaviour changes) — it just names them with canonical reason codes.
